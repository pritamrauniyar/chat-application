# UI Engineer 1 Position at Flipkart

This repository contains the code and details for the UI Engineer 1 position at Flipkart.

## Position Details

- Position: UI Engineer 1
- Company: Flipkart
- Location: Bangalore, India
- Date: May 2023

## Hiring Process

After applying for the UI Engineer 1 position at Flipkart, I was contacted by a recruiter a couple of weeks later. The recruiter informed me that I had been shortlisted for the UI Engineer 1 hiring drive. The hiring process consisted of four rounds of interviews:

1. Problem Solving and Data Structures Round (~60 mins)
2. Machine Coding Round (~120 mins)
3. UI Technologies Round (~60 mins)
4. HM Round (~40 mins)

### Round 1: Problem Solving and Data Structures Round

In this round, the focus was mainly on problem-solving using JavaScript and analyzing time and space complexity.

**Question 1:** Given an array, I had to find a peak element. A peak element is defined as an element where both its left and right neighbors are smaller than the current element. If the array had multiple peak elements, returning any one of them was acceptable.

**Question 2:** There was an array containing negative and positive asteroids. Negative and positive asteroids can only collide with each other. Negative asteroids were represented by negative elements, and positive asteroids were represented by positive elements. After a collision, the greater asteroid would remain, and the smaller asteroid would be destroyed. I had to return the list of asteroids that remained after the collisions.

**Question 3:** Bonus Question: To find the number of plots in a 2D matrix. A plot is defined as a group of land cells connected to each other. The matrix contained 0s and 1s, where 0 represented water and 1 represented land.

I performed well in this round and received a call for the next round.

### Round 2: Machine Coding Round

In this round, I was given 90 minutes to code a problem statement, followed by a 30-minute discussion with the interviewer.

I was given a task to implement the frontend of a chat application similar to web.whatsapp.com. The application required both mandatory and optional features. I built the application using Vanilla JavaScript and plain CSS, without using any frameworks or libraries. I used object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS) and focused on creating reusable components. I was provided with an API endpoint URL that returned mock data, which consisted of an array of objects containing contact details and message lists.

Using this data, I implemented the following features:

- Left view/panel: A scrollable list of contacts with images, titles, dates, etc.
- Right view/panel: Clicking on a contact opens a chat window that displays previous messages and allows input for sending messages. The messages are persisted using localStorage.
- Left panel search box: Allows searching for contacts by order ID and title.
- Styling: Implemented the styling according to the shared design, which was similar to WhatsApp Web.

I was able to implement most of the required features in this repository.

**Bonus features:** Unfortunately, I don't recall the details of the bonus features.

However, I did not proceed to the next round as I was not selected. The feedback I received was that I needed to improve my basic JavaScript skills. I accepted the feedback and committed to learning and improving.

I hope this article and code can be helpful to those pursuing their dream job. Best of luck to you!
